# vim-mysql-mtr

This project goal is to provide proper syntax highlighting when editing [MySQL Test Framework](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_MYSQL_TEST_RUN.html) source files.

The text below is an adapted quote from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_INTRODUCTION.html:

> The application that runs MySQL test suite is named ```mysql-test-run.pl```. Its location is the mysql-test directory (that is referenced in [ftdetect/mysql-mtr.vim](ftdetect/mysql-mtr.vim)), which is present both in source and binary MySQL Server distributions.
> 
> On platforms other than Windows, ```mysql-test-run.pl``` is also available through the shortened name ```mtr``` in the same directory, as either a symbolic link or a copy.
